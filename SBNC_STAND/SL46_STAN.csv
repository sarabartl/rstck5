"line","speaker","text"
1,"A","yeah so which one do you think is going to be the best for the blog then?"
2,"B","that would be this one"
3,"A","mm <pause> Tumblr or the other one?"
4,"B","well <pause> it wouldn't hurt to publish different articles on both of them"
5,"A","okay"
6,"B","mm"
7,"A","there's also MacMillan"
8,"B","yeah and you can test these things"
9,"A","mm <pause> Macmillan's got erm the late the the erm it has got a bit it has got a bit out of date but they did have erm some guest blogs"
10,"B","mm mm"
11,"A","on the subject of small talk <pause> but that's okay I mean we could do that for for later"
12,"B","yeah"
13,"A","when I'm when I'm a bit more kind of into it"
14,"B","to start with I wonder whether Macmillan Macmillan's the right type of site? <pause> because it is a publisher isn't it?"
15,"A","yeah but"
16,"B","and so do people buy books straight from their site?"
17,"A","the guest blog is just about small talk"
18,"B","mm mm I know that"
19,"A","yeah"
20,"B","so you want to put it in front of an audience?"
21,"A","and well yeah I see what you are saying so what kind of direct direct sales would you say would come from Tumblr? was it push it to Amazon? or how does it click through?"
22,"B","well the intention would be <pause> push it through to Amazon"
23,"A","mm"
24,"B","erm so people read the blog click through that goes to a website"
25,"A","mm"
26,"B","which then advertises the book and site that talks about small talk"
27,"A","yeah so it's really it's a you know"
28,"B","and then people click through from that site"
29,"A","and you are also having to advertise on Amazon too to get people to Amazon <pause> to the book"
30,"B","yeah"
31,"A","which is part of the way it works"
32,"B","yeah you don't want to be writing something and advertising AAmazon or a click through straight to Amazon because people won't buy it"
33,"A","ah right so how do you do it instead?"
34,"B","you do the click through to your website which provides extra valuable information"
35,"A","oh so you have to have a website"
36,"B","yeah <pause> mm mm"
37,"A","oh right oh"
38,"B","so"
39,"A","and does that mean that people can also order a erm a hard copy too <pause> from the website?"
40,"B","at the moment because of the erm the arrangement with Amazon you can't you can't sell directly from your website"
41,"A","mm"
42,"B","yeah so if we had a different arrangement you could"
43,"A","right"
44,"B","so <pause> erm millions and millions larger than than the crowd that we have so that that makes sense to just have it there at the moment"
45,"A","mm"
46,"B","and you may decide down the track that you take the book off there and you sell it directly from your own website or something"
47,"A","okay so as long as you're <pause> as long as you are following the Amazon rurules you should be sweet"
48,"B","yes that's it that's the thing"
49,"A","mm mm so <pause> and do they? how do it how do you learn about what they're actually proposing? is there it's kind of like a you know a quite a detailed bunch of information?"
50,"B","whwho is proposing?"
51,"A","Amazon how they <cough> how they get you to you know publish your book online and <pause> how do how you find out about the latest developments do they email you? or do they just expect you to sort of know it?"
52,"B","no they have a massive resource centre behind them"
53,"A","do they?"
54,"B","mm"
55,"A","so there's people you can even contact and say look I don't really understand how to do this bit and they would get back to you?"
56,"B","yeah that's right"
57,"A","oh okay"
58,"B","mm <pause> like a business you know you're you're a customer of theirs"
59,"A","yeah <pause> mm mm"
60,"B","and they are selling you the idea that you can publish your stuff on this site"
61,"A","mm mm"
62,"B","and sell your products through them or whatever yeah"
63,"A","mm mm"
64,"B","so the other day I was listening to a podcast where this guy was saying how erm <pause> asked them do they want to sell their products on Amazon?"
65,"A","oh right"
66,"B","so this guy was seeking advice"
67,"A","yeah"
68,"B","about <pause> bearing in mind Amazon has a large a lot larger customer base"
69,"A","mm"
70,"B","should should they do this? should they be erm they don't have to worry about the hassle they basically supply Amazon with the product and Amazon does all of the <pause> selling and shipping"
71,"A","mm"
72,"B","right"
73,"A","mm mm"
74,"B","so the feedback to this guy was well <pause> your own existing customer base if you then go and sell your products on Amazon your own personal customer base is moving to Amazon so it becomes Amazon's customers they are no longer your customers"
75,"A","mm"
76,"B","so then what control do you then have? yeah"
77,"A","yeah"
78,"B","so as good a deal as it might be it takes a lot of the hassle out of the business and all that kind of thing the major part of it is that Amazon end up with your customers"
79,"A","mm"
80,"B","so that that isn't a great idea you know"
81,"A","no"
82,"B","now there might be another situation where you as a <pause> as a company are selling your products via Amazon yeah"
83,"A","mm mm <pause> yeah"
84,"B","and then Amazon pitches to you well <pause> there was a discussion behind that that kind of point of view as well and you could apply that first kind of reason"
85,"A","mm"
86,"B","with your customers but in fact they're not your customers they are Amazon's customers who happen to buy your products that you're providing through Amazon's platform store"
87,"A","yeah"
88,"B","so <pause> that in itself could be seen as a as a benefit unless you were the type of business person who would actively try to chase Amazon's customers having bought your products because once they've bought them you have got some of the details"
89,"A","mm"
90,"B","and that you would then <pause> based on you know you have bought my product here are some other products that you might like and that kind of stuff yeah"
91,"A","yeah"
92,"B","now if they're Amazon's customers Amazon has that data you will only have that if you have got to ship stuff to them if you don't ship stuff to them then how do you get hold of that data?"
93,"A","mm I see <pause> what do you think of the curry?"
94,"B","yeah it is good <pause> reliably spicy"
95,"A","mm <pause> so you who are you expecting tonight then?"
96,"B","well tonight we are having a chat about that <place> event"
97,"A","oh yeah"
98,"B","erm <pause> just to try and set an agenda for it"
99,"A","yep"
100,"B","for for for the weekend"
101,"A","mm mm so who do you think will be hanging out?"
102,"B","well there's a couple of people who have been involved in setting it up so they're there"
103,"A","mm mm"
104,"B","I haven't really checked out who else has kind of put their hand up to say they would be going along"
105,"A","oh right"
106,"B","like going along to this hang out tonight"
